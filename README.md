# nosql-challenge
The challenge i am uploading here sets up a database and uses Jupyter notebook to update the database as well as doing some exploratory analysis. The only problem 
I ran into was the establishments resource file which was too big for direct upload so I opened the file and pasted the code into a Json file. My hope is that 
the file still works regardless.
